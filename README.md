PROJECT DESCRIPTION									

(1) I generate content for my group which has been promoted on corporate social media pages @ExperienceORISE, formerly @ORISEaspire. ExperienceORISE is the social media platform dedicated to Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE)-administered research participation programs. @ExperienceORISE has over 7,000 followers across four channels: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. 


(2) I created a strategic social media marketing plan for a local business as a project in college. I undertook this project at no cost to the company. A need was idenfitfied where Swan Lake Golf Course in Clarksville, TN, was in desperate need of expanding their reach and presence on social media. I sought to develop a strategic social media marketing plan to improve customer service, enhance a positive brand perception, develop crisis communications, and create conversations around the business.
